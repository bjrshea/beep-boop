# _Beep-Boop: The Number Counter_

#### _An application using frontend/backend logic and looping to count numbers, August 17th, 2018._

#### By _**Brendan Shea**_

## Description

_Beep-Boop is an application that takes a number from the user. Beep-Boop then processes that number and typically sends back the number you inputted and all the numbers that precede that number.

The program also sends back special responses when you submit a number that contains a 0, 1, or a number that's divisible by 3._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Start by creating your directory, making a hidden .git file, and creating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file for all of your code (folders for images and your JS/CSS files are highly recommended for organization)._
* _Create a remote GitHub repository and link that to your directory using this command: "git remote add 'remote nickname' (remote url)."_
* _Download both jQuery and Bootstrap and link them in the head of your HTML file after the skeleton is built. Also, *make sure* the element containing Bootstrap is *above* your CSS element._
* _Start by creating the structure of your HTML file and the submit button needed to take response._
* _Jump into JavaScript and create your Frontend Logic first._
* _After your Frontend logic is completed, start on your Business Logic._
* _When logic is completed, begin styling the page._

_NOTE: make frequent commits using your computer's terminal and push commits to GitHub._
